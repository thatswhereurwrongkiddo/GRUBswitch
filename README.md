# GRUBswitch v0.1

GRUBswitch is a program that aims to provide solace to indecisive people such as me
who always have had issues with picking only one theme for GRUB.


GRUBswitch works by taking 2 (support for more coming soon) different themes, and alternating
between them each time the GRUBswitch.sh script is run.

Setting up GRUBswitch for the first time
----

- Copy your two themes into GRUBswitch/src/grub_th
- Name the first one you want to use "grub_th1" and the other "grub_th2"

Running GRUBswitch
----

- Open a terminal session in the GRUBswitch folder and run the following command:
```
sudo bash GRUBswitch.sh
```
